# Sorella-Interview-Project
Implement concurrency to communicate shared state using total order multicast between different workers in Golang; we use a structure similar to the ISIS system by requesting proposals from all nodes in the group.


At Sorella, the problems we tackle are focused on taking deeply academic concepts and applying them as they benefit our use. As such, most of the development requires learning on the job in completely unfamiliar areas and referencing journal papers/niche sources to problem solve and puzzle when you get stuck.

As such, I think it is only fitting that the interview test takes the form of a week long, open-resource coding project in an area tangential to what we do at Sorella. Your project will be to implement a total order multicast service using a distributed algorithm in Golang.
